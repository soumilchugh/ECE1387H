ECE1387 - CAD: Assignment 1 - Maze Router
Soumil Chugh

Compiling the Router:
On ECF systems, the router can be compiled using 'make' on the command line.

Running the Router:
To run the router, run './router <circuit>' where <circuit> is a test file, formatted as described in the assignment handout.
Please note that the values of W for test case 3 and 4 were changed in the file because for W= 10, the code wasn't giving all the routes. Hence using experimentation, W was found that was giving most of the correct routes and the value was updated in these files.
